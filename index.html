        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are a small local body of believers in Wichita Falls, Texas and we eagerly desire a Pastor-Teacher who is searching for a flock.</p>
        <p>We are looking for a leader who will use exegetical, categorical, isagogic, and  hermeneutical processes to study and teach sound Bible Doctrine from the original languages of the Christian scriptures to our local body of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, until we all “…have attained the goal because of the consistency of the doctrine and the epignosis of the Son of God, with reference to a mature nobleman to the standard of the maturity which belongs to the fullness of the Christ.” (Ephesians 4:13)</p>

        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <p>We believe the Holy Scriptures are the inspired, authoritative, inerrant, and God-breathed Word of God (II Timothy 3:16-17; II Peter 1:20-21). We affirm the existence of one triune God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—eternal, equal in power, glory, and attributes (Deuteronomy 6:4; II Corinthians 13:14). Additionally, we hold that man, created in God’s image, fell through Adam’s sin, inheriting a sinful nature, becoming alienated from God, and is unable to redeem himself (Genesis 1:26-27; Romans 3:22-23; Ephesians 2:12).</p>
        <p>We believe Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man while remaining fully God, born of the Virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit, to reveal God and redeem humanity through His substitutionary death on the cross and literal resurrection (John 1:1-2, 14; Romans 3:24-25; I Peter 1:3-5). The Holy Spirit, co-equal and co-eternal with the Father and Son, convicts the world of sin, indwells believers, seals them for redemption, and empowers them to be filled with His presence (John 16:8; Ephesians 1:13-14; 5:18). Salvation is a gift of grace through faith in Christ’s efficacious death, reconciling man to God, and believers are eternally secure (Ephesians 2:8-10; Romans 8:1, 38-39).</p>
        <p>We believe the Church is a spiritual organism of born-again believers in the Church Age, forming the Body and future Bride of Christ (Ephesians 1:22-23; I Corinthians 12:12-14). The Rapture will signal the end of the Church Age, followed by the Tribulation and Christ’s Second Coming to establish His kingdom (I Thessalonians 4:13-18; Revelation 20:6). Believers’ souls enter Christ’s presence at death, awaiting bodily resurrection to eternal glory, while unbelievers face eternal punishment after the final judgment (Luke 16:19-26; Revelation 20:11-15). Believers are called to live righteously, witness to the Gospel, and support the local assembly (Romans 12:1-2; Acts 1:8; I Corinthians 16:2).</p>

        <p>If you understand and possess the gift of Pastor-Teacher (Ephesians 4:11), are willing to communicate face-to-face consistently and regularly to the assembled body of believers (Ephesians 4:12 ff, Hebrews 10:25), and are academically qualified to study and teach from the original languages (proficient in Greek and Hebrew; use the literal, grammatical, historical approach; follow the rules of Hermeneutics.), we are ready to "receive the Word with total readiness and examine the scriptures you present!" (Acts 17:11)</p>
